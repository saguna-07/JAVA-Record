                               AWAKING A HUMAN FACE USING APPLETS
Aim:
To write and execute a Java Applet program to draw a human face using the `Graphics` class and its drawing methods.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Import the required `java.awt`, `java.io`, and `java.applet` packages.
3. Create a class named `face` that extends the `Applet` class.
4. Override the `paint(Graphics g)` method.
5. Use `drawOval()` to draw the face, eyes, and ears.
6. Use `fillOval()` to draw the pupils of the eyes.
7. Use `fillArc()` to draw the nose and mouth.
8. Execute the applet to display the face.
9. Stop the program.

Code:
import java.awt.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.applet.*;

public class face extends Applet
{
   /*
<applet code="face.class" width="300" height="300">
</applet>
*/ public void paint(Graphics g)
    {
        g.drawOval(40, 40, 120, 150);
        g.drawOval(57, 75, 30, 20);
        g.drawOval(110, 75, 30, 20);

        g.drawOval(68, 81, 10, 10);
        g.fillOval(121, 81, 10, 10);

        g.fillArc(85, 100, 30, 30, 0, 180);
        g.fillArc(60, 125, 80, 40, 180, 180);

        g.drawOval(25, 92, 15, 30);
        g.drawOval(160, 92, 15, 30);
    }
}

Result:
Thus, the Java Applet program was executed successfully to draw a human face using the `Graphics` class and its methods such as `drawOval()`, `fillOval()`, and `fillArc()`.
